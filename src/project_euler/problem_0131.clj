;; There are some prime values, p, for which there exists a positive integer, n,
;; such that the expression n^3 + n^2p is a perfect cube.

;; For example, when p = 19, 8^3 + 8^2Ã—19 = 12^3.

;; What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property
;; the value of n is unique, and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.

;; How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?

;; From problem 0010 :

(defn prime?
  [n]
  {:pre [(integer? n) (> n 0)]}
  (or (== 2 n)
      (let [mmax (+ (Math/sqrt n) 1)]
        (not (some #(== 0 (rem n %)) (concat [2] (range 3 mmax 2))))
        )))
