;; Consider the following "magic" 3-gon ring, filled with the numbers 1 to 6, and each line adding to nine.

;; Working clockwise, and starting from the group of three with the numerically lowest external node
;; (4,3,2 in this example), each solution can be described uniquely.
;; For example, the above solution can be described by the set: 4,3,2; 6,2,1; 5,1,3.

;; It is possible to complete the ring with four different totals: 9, 10, 11, and 12.
;; There are eight solutions in total.

;; Total	Solution Set
;; 9	4,2,3; 5,3,1; 6,1,2
;; 9	4,3,2; 6,2,1; 5,1,3
;; 10	2,3,5; 4,5,1; 6,1,3
;; 10	2,5,3; 6,3,1; 4,1,5
;; 11	1,4,6; 3,6,2; 5,2,4
;; 11	1,6,4; 5,4,2; 3,2,6
;; 12	1,5,6; 2,6,4; 3,4,5
;; 12	1,6,5; 3,5,4; 2,4,6
