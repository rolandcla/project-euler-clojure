;; If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs,
;; composed of fifteen blue discs and six red discs, and two discs were taken at random,
;; it can be seen that the probability of taking two blue discs, P(BB) = (15/21)Ã—(14/20) = 1/2.

;; The next such arrangement,
;; for which there is exactly 50% chance of taking two blue discs at random,
;; is a box containing eighty-five blue discs and thirty-five red discs.

;; By finding the first arrangement to contain over 10^12 = 1,000,000,000,000 discs in total,
;; determine the number of blue discs that the box would contain.
