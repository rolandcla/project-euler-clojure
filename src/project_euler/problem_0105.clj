;; Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n.
;; We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C,
;; the following properties are true:

;; S(B) â‰  S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
;; If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).
;; For example, {81, 88, 75, 42, 87, 84, 86, 65} is not a special sum set
;; because 65 + 87 + 88 = 75 + 81 + 84, whereas {157, 150, 164, 119, 79, 159, 161, 139, 158}
;; satisfies both rules for all possible subset pair combinations and S(A) = 1286.

;; Using sets.txt (right click and "Save Link/Target As..."),
;; a 4K text file with one-hundred sets containing seven to twelve elements
;; (the two examples given above are the first two sets in the file),
;; identify all the special sum sets, A1, A2, ..., Ak, and find the value of S(A1) + S(A2) + ... + S(Ak).

;; NOTE"" This problem is related to Problem 103 and Problem 106.
